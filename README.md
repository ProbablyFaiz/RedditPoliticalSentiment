# RedditPoliticalSentiment
Part of an ongoing project to test whether there is a statistically significant difference between the sentiment (positivity) of Reddit comments on liberal and conservative subreddits.

If you wish to download this and test it, you will have to provide your own Reddit API information (see https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/quick_start.html), ParallelDots API secret key, and install all the packages used via pip. I plan to generalize this project into an easy-to-use sentiment tracker so I can conduct other interesting studies like tracking change in sentiment after certain events.

Disclaimer: This was the first thing I'd ever written in Python and so it does not follow Pythonic conventions in a great number of ways.
