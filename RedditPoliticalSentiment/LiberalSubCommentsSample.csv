The real goal of the Federalist Society is turn the country into a corporate tyranny state.    They have already done this in many ways.  For instance every corporate employee in this country can no longer sue their employer in a class action law suit because the new Supreme Court just approved the legality of non binding arbitration agreements.  When a person is hired at say a Chipotele, he has to sign an agreement to not sue them and to settle all disputes through an arbitrator who is usually hired by you guessed it Chipotele.   So if Choptele wants to steal an hour of work from every employee once a week, the employees can no longer get together as a group and sue.  They have hire their own lawyer and settle it out of court through an arbitrator.  This is a real life example BTW>"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,politics           ,1556002849  ,catfarts99          ,elk1qp4,-0.834
"You want a reason from someone who dislikes him?

He is ineffectual. He cannot pass laws. He lied repeatedly in 2016. He lied about releasing his taxes. He lied about becoming a Democrat. He slung mud at Hillary Clinton for no reason other than to try to win a losing battle. He's a protectionist. He is too friendly to gun companies. He is a self-proclaimed socialist. His wife took thousands of dollars from his 2006 campaign in profit. He is *still* blaming his loss by over 3.8 million votes on superdelegates. He keeps hiring people who have done nothing but attack other Democrats and sow division. He's not a uniter, he's a divider.

There's a whole lot more, but long story short: I think he's a piece of shit."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,politics           ,1556003289  ,TheExtremistModerate,elk213s,-0.93

"Each executive agency does have internal checks in the form of Inspectors General, and I don't think anyone disagrees with internal checks where each level is accountable to the next higher echelon. The question is what happens when you reach the top. The opinion of the OLC, which I agree with, is that the president and VP, being the only executive positions chosen by the people themselves, should be answerable to the same people via their elected representatives, not to their own subordinates. In the author's own words:

>The Framers considered who should possess the extraordinary power of deciding whether to initiate a proceeding that could remove the President -- one of only two constitutional officers elected by the people as a whole -- and placed that responsibility in the elected officials of Congress. It would be inconsistent with that carefully considered judgment to permit an unelected grand jury and prosecutor effectively to ""remove"" a President by bringing criminal charges against him while he remains in office.

As much as I may dislike the implications for this particular case, I can't disagree with the reasoning. Hamilton, arguing against entrusting the Supreme Court with impeachment/removal powers, writes that the ""awful"" discretion such a body must necessarily have forbids the commitment of the trust to a small number of persons. I think the same argument precludes allowing any individual prosecutor or grand jury the ability to unilaterally remove *de facto* a president for potentially corrupt or partisan purposes."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,politics           ,1556010766  ,lexachronical       ,elk6dhh,-0.505

"Conservatives view this all as sport. Fans never care when their side gets away with a foul. They successfully stole an Obama SCOTUS pick and got there trillion dollar debt inflating tax cut.

"""The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion.""

""As set forth in detail in this report, the Special Counsel's investigation established that Russia interfere~ in the 2016 presidential election principally through two operations. First, a
Russian entity carried out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Second, a Russian intelligence
service conducted computer-intrusion operations against entities, employees, and volunteers working on the Clinton Campaign and then released stolen documents. The investigation also

A) you spelled it wrong and B) those are simply positions he is claiming to have. I'm talking about actual policy. Pete was even asked yesterday why he doesn't talk about specific policies and he gave a garbage answer about not wanting to get bogged down in policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ,politics           ,1556027399  ,BAHatesToFly        ,elkm4xc,-0.748
"He essentially said ""We shouldn't impeach because it will distract from the serious issues"" which is an odd argument to me. Does he really think people are incapable of caring about more than one thing? Actually makes sense why he drives every single thing back to healthcare if so."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ,politics           ,1556027828  ,thelasttruffula     ,elkmri4,-0.839

"Can't.  Its literally in the constitution of when the next president takes over.  Its automatic.  Nothing the senate can pass can override the constitution.

It happens automatically at noon on inauguration day.)

"Currently there's people who buy meat with food stamps and pawn it for cash for drugs.

There's disability scams.

Families who have kids just for the extra benefits.

That's shitty.

But there's also people whose lives have changed because of welfare, they have created jobs, companies, organizations. 

There will always be problem people but they shouldn't disqualify a program.

Then you form an LLC called my jet and yacht LLC and rent it out a couple times, and then all your fuel and equipment and repairs and maintenance becomes a business expense.  You can deduct interest in a boat loan as long as it has a bed, a kitchenette and a toilet, because it's a second home.

"You can't or more like they don't *want* to, welfare is purposefully designed this way as the article mentions which is extremely dehumanizing. And again, welfare traps. 

Something like this has been going on in Alaska the last few decades without intervention from the state government. People know their own needs better than the government is the rhetoric in this case and it typically holds true."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,politics           ,1556032547  ,Veloxc              ,elku51w,-0.504
It's okay if you are unsure on how to do that. That's the power in the collective to come together to craft a society that is less cruel and brutal.

"Yeah, results are inflated from 2018 Midterms.


In past 90 days, Bernie is top result in most states. But in like half of them, Beto is just behind him. So not a big lead for Bernie, but it shows both of them are most interesting per Google searches. Kamala is 3rd in terms of widespread interest, with no surprise topping in California and the Black Belt states. Meanwhile Biden is really only topping in Deleware and in equal position with Sanders and Beto in a few Red States. Pete is popular in... Indiana.

So if I would to judge from Google trends, Bernie, Beto and Hattis are top candidates. Hell Biden peaked in interest due to sexual harrasment. But he has yet to announce he is running( he is taking money though) so it's hard to tell anyway. Pete is just a media darling atm, unless he consolidates with a serious presidential campaign and strategy soon, he will collapse eventually."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ,neoliberal         ,1556034501  ,CroGamer002         ,elkxbd2,-0.403

"Failing to imprison Nixon already set the precedent. 

Failing to impeach or imprison Reagan already set the precedent. 

Failing to impeach or imprison Bush already set the precedent. 

The rich and powerful are untouchable in this country, and presidents can really get away with anything they can stomach doing. We can pretend our ""system"" is robust enough to deal with it, but the fact that Manafort is headed to a light sentence in a minimum security prison is proof that our system is a joke. We are more like Russia than we like to admit."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ,politics           ,1556035013  ,smp501              ,elky5mi,-0.864
I think soon enough we will see the dam break and all this will hit us hard and fast. It's the only real way to deal with trump and Co at this point. Go hard all over and at once. So they don't have time to coordinate by catching them off guard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ,politics           ,1556035178  ,Ribble382           ,elkyf6e,-0.567

What is wrong am I missing something is this how a President is supposed to act on daily?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ,politics           ,1556037570  ,TheBlindMerc        ,ell2clt,-0.035

>I'm pro choice, but I agree that some restrictions should be placed on extreme forms of abortion, such as third-term or sex selective abortion.  

If you're pro-choice stop peddling the myth that people are getting 3rd trimesters abortions for literally no medical reason. 

These laws have one purpose and thats to make legal abortion go away.

You can't comment on something without bias, unless you are literally just repeating what happened, but even that will have bias seeping through."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ,politics           ,1556037888  ,Grumpchkin          ,ell2vlt,-0.651

"Hey look I get what you are arguing for and your stance. But language like this is really dangerous. Sure it's all about equal votes and a level playing field now but this is a slope you don't want to slip down. 

""The minority should not be more important than the majority."" 

Man I know that sounds good in your context but it wasn't more than a few decades ago that my grandpa was told this from white people constantly about being a black man in America. This is dangerous because mob rule seems like a good thing now but in reality it's opening the doors up for an even more chaotic and dangerous political environment. 

Let's just say it would be a lot more common that people interfere in our elections and the more alienated groups of people will feel which turns into anger which becomes motivation. People can change and be manipulated. Before you know in a couple generations we are in a worse spot than before with a majority rule since minorities don't matter.

What it was taken a step further and the citizens voted on everything? Ah jeez down to even local elections being mob rule.

"Like, I applaud the guy/gal and all, but for fucks sake, the circles this person has run in constitute the Darkside


I just cant see how these people are totes kewl with all these shitty GOP agendas, ideas and policies but they arent ok with Trump...as shit as Trump is 90% of the things he has gotten done are mainline GOP things, and I feel that these people are just upset that Trump is making the GOP look bad and as soon as a respectable person who shares all of Trumps agenda comes around they will line up behind them with no qualms


I'm just saying, consider the source, and note that hardly any of these people that are ""Defecting"" ever mention that they are upset with the substance of this administration, just the behavior of the President.

if it were President Romney or Rubio doing everything Trumps been doing in the policy sphere they would be on the National Mall with Pompoms cheering him up and down the street"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ,politics           ,1556040756  ,padizzledonk        ,ell7i47,-0.008

"Was Obama the only one ever to release tax returns, or did other presidents do that too?

I believe there's plenty of shit Trump's done in terms of tax fraud and other white collar crimes, but we have to wait until he's out of office to prosecute that or else he can pardon himself.

In the meantime, harping on it (and it seems like I can't go a day without reading about it) is one of the ways to give the idiots on the opposing side more fodder ""All they do is complain about his tax returns! What about the real issues!?""

"I just want to point out again how markedly different it is when Sanders reaches out to expand his coalition versus Third Way Democrats like Clinton and Biden. Bernie just talks to people, engaging them on their news networks and in their cities, attempting to spread the appeal of the ideas and policies he thinks we need. The Third Way actually modulate their positions and messaging depending on who they're talking to, taking on their ideas (and in the process selling out their left wing base).

"He voted against a bill to try and destroy the judge selection process to something the Republicans could hijack. He voted against another 3 or 4 ridiculous bills as well, just this year. 

He may be a right leaning Dem, but he isn't screwing over the state for the Reps and he never was. During Ray's tenure Reps helped shape a collective bargaining system that was great and now they dismantled it. This gentleman did not get to vote on that as he was elected after, but I think he would have voted with Dems. 

So he may not be a progressive, but he is an ally and still a Dem when one is needed."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ,politics           ,1556047594  ,ragnarocknroll      ,ellidwy,-0.685

Our legal system is based on legal ideas going back to greco roman times. There are in fact precedents that have been accepted from before the constitution. Laws exist seperate from governments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,politics           ,1556050156  ,greiton             ,ellmnl2,-0.503

"There most certainly is room for Biden. He is literally the only one who has the potential to draw in moderates from both parties. While I like a lot of what Sanders has to say, I fear that he and Warren are to far left.  This election is far too important to take a chance. I admit Biden has baggage, but he is also a fighter and he has substantial experience, as well as recognition among  foreign leaders. Best of all, it's pretty much a given that Senate majority won't dare play games w him they did w President Obama."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,politics           ,1556051106  ,disdainfulsideeye   ,ello8aj,0.507

"> The only educated people used to be religious, because everyone was religious, IE Mendel. In the modern era, with modern science and the understanding of the natural world

I dealt with that by not using examples exclusively from 100 AD. Note the march from Selma (which incidentally ends in my favorite speech from MLK Jr). You are saying religion necessarily results only in bad. I pointed out counterpoints disproving that hypothesis.

I can only present evidence for points of data. It is always up to you what you choose to believe. If you choose to continue believing all religion can only be bad, that's your stance not supported by evidence or history."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ,politics           ,1556051992  ,PeterNguyen2        ,ellpp5z,0.522

Assange would have used the evidence to invalidate Russia claims and support his innocence.  if that link actually existed Assange wouldn't have held it back it would given more credibly to the bullshit conspiracy theory and to Hannity who was helping him by continuously giving attention to something that was someone's tin foil hat musing that he acted like had been carved on a stone tablet at the direction of God.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,politics           ,1556053451  ,JLBesq1981          ,ells1rv,-0.334

There is already enough to Impeach. It is easy for the Senate to seem like an unmovable object when it doesn't even get tested. Let's not forget the Senate folded on Trump during the Shutdown.

">i kinda like the idea, however unlikely it is, that the president and democrats give more powers to the EPA if they win in 2 years, which all but in name will allow them to implement a carbon tax of sorts - it's severely unlikely, because it would require the senate, the house AND probably the courts to ever get it done

Obama regulated carbon emissions directly through the EPA, and he was able to do so under the Clean Air act.

It's not an optimal solution, carbon taxes are better, but it's certainly doable when there's a Democrat in the white house."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,neoliberal         ,1556054822  ,Yosarian2           ,ellu5pq,0.764
"Isn't the point of protecting anonymity to protect the source from repercussion.  There's no need if the source was already murdered.

Further, doesn't offering money for solving Seth's murder and playing coy about it completely fly in the face of that ""protecting anonymity""?  If Seth Rich really was the source, and they were truly trying to protect his anonymity, then they would have been careful not to do anything that would imply that he was the source."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,politics           ,1556055545  ,rogmew              ,ellv98n,-0.875
"This is untrue, but of course she said that because she will tell whatever lies she thinks will help her get elected. Parents in other districts went to jail when other districts adopted these policies. Kamala's unacceptable policy caused parents to go to jail, and for some reason you're okay with it? If a Republican had done this, Democrats would protest and call out racism, because this disproportionately impacts people of color. Utter hypocrisy.

"Dem voters didn't fail to turn out because of Bernie. They failed to turn out because Hilary Clinton made no attempt to connect with working class voters. To quote Schumer on the Hillary campaign, ""For every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia"". You cannot blame workers for not voting in a  contemptible character like Clinton, who made it clear she did not give a fuck about them. You want to win back the rust belt? Then you need a trustworthy progressive candidate who already is polling super well.

"1)Jesus did to you not click on the link that proves you wrong? You can't be that dumb can you?

Is it shitty for Twitter to sit back counting their money while bots and nutjobs make a mockery of our country? Absolutely it is. But companies are sometimes (usually) shitty. It's our responsibility to make it clear we don't support their actions. 

I just don't understand how everyone seems to know social media is a fucking virus, but nobody wants to wash their hands."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,politics           ,1556064449  ,Felzlek             ,elm7m9o,0.824

"If you read the article, it is exactly because Trump is claiming privilege. 

Klein is an employee of the DOD and therefore an employee of the President. The President has demanded that a white house representative be present during the interview to ensure executive privilege is afforded. Congress has refused. Therefore the President has ordered his employee to not appear because executive privilege cannot be exercised if the executive cannot review all requests and inquiries.

This federal employee is faced with disobeying the orders of the President (who can fire him) or disobeying the orders of Congress, who could charge him with contempt. 

It's a lose-lose situation, but I'd probably do the same thing and side with the co-equal branch of government that can fire me, revoke my clearance, and essentially blacklist me from working in the sector I've spent my entire career in."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,politics           ,1556066142  ,drajgreen           ,elm9z3e,-0.067

">CK2 had half the map unplayable at release (god help you if somebody not of your religion inherits),

This doesn't mean the game wasn't fleshed out. Originally CK2 wasn't planned to have that content to begin with. It's not like there was some oversight, the game was originally built to, like the original, just be about being Christian Kingdoms and the Crusades, and was built from the ground-up to be a feudalism simulator - something which doesn't make much sense outside of Christendom. That content was outside of the scope of the original build. But over time the game became less and less about that and expanded into other places.

This has actually been a running problem with the game, as it injects feudal systems into places of the world that didn't really have such an arrangement, and so you have things like the Caliphates and ERE basically acting as somewhat tweaked feudal states when they never really had such a system.

>EU4 didn't even have all the mechanics from DLC'd EU3,

What mechanic was it missing which wasn't largely missing because they were/were being overhauled? Hell, most of the major mechanics from EU3 and its Expansions (CB system, EoC system, faction systems, HRE system, papal mechanics etc.) were in the game at release. Most of the DLC since release has been replacing the pretty bad EU3 systems with better, less painful and obtuse ones.

>and Stellaris has been reworked over so much that it's almost a new game now than when it was initially released.

But again, this doesn't mean that Stellaris at release was broken or lacking features. Stellaris was perfectly functional, the team just radically changed their vision for the game several times since then. If this had been 10 years ago, instead of being implemented through patches and DLCs it would have just been sold as a sequel, Stellaris II.

Like, yeah, the game has been massively reworked in the last few years, but this isn't the same as saying that the game was bad or incomplete on release.

"Why do we have to change the social conventions around nudity? Why can't we accept that modesty about one's body can be a natural, even healthy attitude to take and that washing in public makes a lot of people uncomfortable without trying to fit a square peg in a round hole?

Eating at home can be private. If I just want to eat without any social pressures about what and how to eat, a private kitchen is essential.

What happened to the Supreme court not being political? I actually  believed that they were trying to stay away from political decisions. I actually believed that they (minus Kavanaugh who is a known hack) would at least uphold the laws of the land and support the reasons for census being used. But Nope. Sounds like this country is as fucked by the courts as we feared.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,politics           ,1556069961  ,M00n                ,elmfd3q,-0.52

"You're kidding me, right? You do realize you can still be alt right and critical of Trump. Shapiro is full of shit on a lot of what he says. He's a sharp, fast talker, but he lacks any real substance. Anyone who actually listen to what he says and deconstructs it should know this. Shapiro is pretty fucking vile and is wholly dishonest in the way he argues about things.
  
Frankly, there aren't many right spokesmen left I could even say I respect these days. It's not because I can't respect someone with a difference of opinion, it's because there's not many respectable right side spokespeople left these days. They've either switched sides because they can't go along with what's going on in the country either, or they're so fully embarrassed with the state of things they've faded into the background."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ,politics           ,1556072171  ,GiveToOedipus       ,elmif9w,-0.955

"I had a Honda Magna (750cc V4 engine) on a Harley-dominated poker run once.  One guy in our group of riders took great pleasure in giving me shit, crowding me on the road, or blasting me with exhaust.  At the BBQ, he was boasting about how much he dropped on a big bore and long stroke kit, exhaust, etc and how much power he was putting out.

I kind of snickered and bit my tongue, he noticed and called me out.  The rest of the table encouraged me to speak up too.  

""I just think it's funny that you spent more money on mods than my old Honda is worth, and still can't get within 20 hp of me.  Maybe that's why I've been out riding you all day while being a broke grad student.""

"I agree. 100%. But at this moment there do not appear to be legal remedies that would remove the law breaker. That's bad. The system is fucked up, but that's not new. That means you have to play this out. I think that's what pelosi is doing. She's letting the popular folks talk about impeachment and she's moving forward on the investigations. We have a long way to go with this criminal (Nov 2020).

">It's just that a guy that inherited 20 KFC franchises in middle America doesn't earn much more than a particularly talented coder.

"> The vast majority of people aren't convicted for violent crimes, and denying someone the right to vote because they were caught selling an ounce of marijuana is undemocratic and indicative of underlying racism given that minorities are disproportionately arrested for drug crimes

1. The solution is to change the law, not give incarcerated people the vote. 

2. People who sell an ounce of weed do so knowing full well it is illegal. 

3. That something happens to disproportionately harm a minority group is not proof of racism (I am not saying America does not have a racism problem)."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,neoliberal         ,1556110952  ,Lord_Treasurer      ,elnil31,0.241

"As a Floridian and someone who went to Florida public schools my entire life, my mother would have never allowed me to attend school if anyone but law enforcement were armed. I'd never let my kids attend either. I've seen too many teachers have scary outbursts and throw things to think that's a good idea at all. My mother thinks this is part of the bigger conspiracy to kill the public education system. Make people afraid to go to school, more schools will close. While I do think the Republican party is trying to destroy public education, I'm not sure this is a step in the plan. Then again, when you aren't a terrible person, it's hard to imagine all the terrible things people can think to do. And, here we are in the world.

At some point our inaction makes us complicit and I fear we've past that threshold                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,politics           ,1556112705  ,onehandsomegamer21  ,elnkzyt,-0.793

">Not going for impeachment until you have more public support when there is so much evidence of criminality sets a very dangerous precedent.

Not really.  Undermining our democracy, going through impeachment, and then having no consequences would have a far deeper impact on future politicians. There won't be anything to deter future demagogues that want to 'Trump' our democracy.

>First off, you should hold Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin in contempt of Congress for not delivering tax returns which the House requested and are now beyond deadline.

>Second, Democrats should fervently rally for the impeachment of Donald J. Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors, which were clearly laid out (intent to obstruct justice; one crime among many) in the report produced by the Special Counsel.

"First, I'm a million percent in agreement with you. Socialism has failed many times in democracies because when the people sieze the means of production and then elect a government, the government controls the means of production. Given general human selfishness, that's a recipe for authoritarianism. 

I feel like ""libertarian socialism"" is paradoxical, as libertarianism is hyper focused on individual property rights while socialism largely denies those rights. I'm all for blending together the best elements of different ideologies, but given how focused those two are on certain features, I feel like any combination of the two would need its own name."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,politics           ,1556124227  ,SeveralWeeks        ,elo3u0z,-0.332

"Not much else is available over here I'm afraid. A few blogs and such are available, I've heard of one called ""the Canary"" but I haven't read into it yet so I can't testify it's quality. Foreign left wing news sources will sometimes cover British topics as well so I'll check them out on occasion.

"This guy is bonkers. Within the last year i moved near where this guy lives and runs some of his events. He runs Pass The Salt ministries. He used to put on these weird Man Camps. You had to meet a certain physical appearance standard. They used to have testimonial videos on those camps and they were the most cringe-worthy things ever. You also must think less of women to be a member. You must believe their role is in the house. He sells shirts that say ""Protect the Flock with a Glock"" and ""Truth Sounds Like Hate.""

He will sometimes live stream from the banks of Buckeye Lake - so if you happen to be boating out there and see a bunch of good ole boys on the banks talking into a phone camera, moon them."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,politics           ,1556127002  ,PoliticalThrowawayy ,elo8i5p,-0.249

"It's because they are trying to maintain some sense of normalcy and decorum. Frankly, the way we're going we are headed back to [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caning_of_Charles_Sumner)

Don't get me wrong, I'm as pissed off as anybody and maybe more so because I've been involved in politics for more than two decades and I have *a lot* of resentment built up. But, Democrats and their constituents - for better or worse - hold themselves to a higher standard. That is certainly in play. 

Also, whatever you may think of the woman, Nancy Pelosi is smart as hell. She has a plan and she's working towards an endgame. I don't necessarily approve and I think it involves the other ongoing investigations, but it isn't like the Democrats are sitting on their hands. We will see other machinations now that the deadline has passed (and the reason for asking is hoping for compliance because the courts are going to drag this out).

What would you have the Democrats do exactly? The freshmen women are acting as the bulldogs (and doing quite a nice job of it). Do you think more people speaking harshly is going to accomplish anything except making all of us feel good?

Again, I would like a more meaningful and hard-line attack on Trump including impeachment, because we cannot let this become the norm and they have a Constitutional obligation, but I do have some faith in Pelosi. She whipped Blue Dogs to commit political suicide and pass the ACA. I have faith in her to let this play out a little longer."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,politics           ,1556130335  ,RegressToTheMean    ,eloe5m4,0.011

There will be many false prophets who are in the game exclusively for a quick buck.  The imposters must be rejected out of hand and cast back into the wilderness where they belong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,politics           ,1556133897  ,AlternativeSuccotash,elok4iu,-0.291

"I am from a science background. I recognize the guy was an amazing writer and that he coined phrases which have deeply permeated day to day speech. However, from a scientific standpoint, none of his ""research"" was really founded on anything. He was a cocaine addict, and his psychoanalysis was nonscientific. Pseudo science is the enemy of actual science.

That said, obviously he propelled the field of psychology by leaps and bounds simply by bringing attention to it. I appreciate what he ended up doing for the field of psychology, but his ideas aren't particularly something I would put much stock in today.

"I'm not as pessimistic. 

Harris is a good example because I like her a lot more than most progressives seem to. There's nothing in her history which screams ""I'm not a progressive!"" So I'm happy to take her at face value, for now. At the very least, I fully believe that if Congress could put a Medicare for All/Green New Deal bill onto President Harris's desk that she would sign it in an instant.

"I just really, really don't think so. I don't think he will pull enough moderates to win. I think in the debates he's going to get his ass rolled by the stupidity of Trump and his schoolyard insults, I think he comes across as very prickly and unlikable, and I don't think your average suburban housewife is going to vote for him. (Remember: those women helped push Trump to where he is now.) 

People are saying the Sting has been taken out of ""socialist"" But politicians have not **described themselves** that way until Sanders.  He really IS their boogeyman."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ,politics           ,1556139618  ,Feed_Me_No_Lies     ,elou51w,-0.378

"Because she's unelectable. Even my very liberal wife isn't sold on her just because she engaged with Trump on her dna crap.  She's toxic just because of that stupid silly shit.  

I'm not sold on her because she's not true.  She's just like Hillary. Used to be conservative now she's claiming progressive because votes.  

However we'll all vote for her if she makes it through the primarys."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ,politics           ,1556140737  ,skankingmike        ,elovyqu,-0.781

"[This](https://web.archive.org/web/20080123104203/www.reddit.com/r/politics) is a snapshot of /r/politics in January 2008.

What you'll find if you view it is just how anti-Bush this place was back then.  Reddit was fervently supportive of Ron Paul and Kucinich and resentful towards Bush, Hillary and other pro-war politicians:

>John Edwards is a member of the Bilderberg group along with Chris Dodd, Bill and Hillary Clinton.I'm not voting for him because of that.Fuck Edwards.

>As a Democrat, I despise the Clintons for the same exact reason I despise (most) Republicans: They consistently mislead and manipulate people for personal gain. What makes the Clintons worse than Republicans is who they manipulate: A working class that may not have enough patience to dig through Clintonian bullshit to find the facts.If the Democrats nominate Clinton, a Republican will be elected in '08, and I think that even the Clintons know this. Once again, another beautiful example of the Clintons putting their own personal aspirations before the interests their party.

>Clinton lies and that makes the news? That bitch has been lying her whole life. Everything she does is corrupt, how can you like that? Do you steal from everyone you know? Then why is she a role model? You act like she is working for you.

Seems like reddit was consistent in its views towards Hillary, until a certain PAC was started by her.

It's highly convenient to claim /r/politics has always supported the democratic candidate, when there was only one single democratic candidate before Hillary.  Someone who stood out from Hillary, who seemed opposed to Bush and his warmongering."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,politics           ,1556142190  ,altmorty            ,eloy7vu,0.015

"How many candidate proposals actually become law?  Nearly all end up as compromise proposals at best.  For example, Warren offers a 'Wealth Tax', which could be perceived as an unconstitutional direct federal on assets, and attempts to lure voters into a concept that this is a direct wealth transfer.  For example, buying millennial votes by suggesting that a wealth tax will pay off $50K of their student loans if they make $100K or less.  Such proposals are populist and shilling for votes at best.

Candidates like Sanders and now Buttigieg focus more on principles and goals, rather than on specific policies."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ,politics           ,1556144072  ,notblueclk          ,elp15x2,-0.351
"Making state schools free is infinitely more fair than rewarding people who made poor choices and took on massive debts instead of doing what lots of other people did which is go to a cheaper community college or state school first and perhaps even working to pay for some it.

Why should my taxes pay for forgiving my friends $250k in debt for a nutrition degree from Standford that they didn't use and are now an ""influencer."" When I took on no debt by going to community college in my hometown before going to a state school?

"Lol. I don't even know why anyone bothered to ask this question! *Of course* they're not going to turn down hacked material, they literally *asked for it* in the last election. 

And why the fuck wouldn't they do it again? What repercussions have Trump or anyone else in the campaign faced for it, aside from the ones who lied to the FBI or had a litany of other crimes they were guilty of. According to Mueller's report, anyone can accept and promote the hacked material to win as long as they weren't in on the hacking itself. There's not even a real reason to lie about it going forward. 

""Yeah, sure, China helped us win with all the documents they stole. So what? We weren't in on the hacking, we just expected to benefit it from it. Go fuck yourself, America, we got ours."" 

And, apparently, that's not illegal. US elections have become the wild west now. Turns out all those 'norms' and 'goof faith' intentions don't actually mean a motherfucking thing anymore. The only thing that matters is that you win and play dumb if anyone accuses you of a crime. 

That's America now."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,politics           ,1556146666  ,barlow_straker      ,elp51mq,-0.606

""" Millions and millions of Americans use their annual refund to pay down debt. For an idea, one out of four Americans use their tax refund to pay debt from holiday spending alone, and today--a decade after the Great Recession--consumer debt is at an all-time high. It's absurd for the GOP to expect middle- and low-income households to budget their incremental withholding gains across twelve months to account for spending, rent, car payments, credit cards, and other debt, but that absurdity rises to the point of cruelty when on top of that we're also now expected to budget for a smaller annual refund, the size of which we can't even be sure of ahead of time.""

Now think about those Americans who will no longer qualify for critical exemptions and see their refunds vanish entirely--and possibly even find they now have to pay more in one lump sum. Add tax debt to that list.

""It's also bad for the U.S. economy. Holiday spending is a critical economic boost for U.S. GDP annually. Consumer spending makes up 70% of our GDP, and about 20% of retail purchases occur over the last two months of the year. If we expect Americans will overhaul their spending and debt habits to account for a smaller annual refund (they won't), consumer spending will drop and the economy will sputter."""                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,politics           ,1556150616  ,JLBesq1981          ,elpaomq,-0.492
