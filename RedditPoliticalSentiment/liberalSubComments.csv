|b"I'm just pointing out the fact that Amazon isn't getting preferential tax rates. Tax rates are applied in the same manner to every company. \n\nA mom and pop shop will still have good and bad years. They can claim their losses from bad years against their profits in good years to minimize tax. \n\nThe headline that Amazon sheltered billions of profits is somewhat misleading. This deduction is 1:1. Amazon claimed billions of deductions because they had billions of losses. A mom and pop shop may only be claiming thousands in deductions, but that's only because they only had thousands in losses. In this regard, the tax treatment is fair - you deduct what you lost, no more, no less.\n\nOnto your comment on venture capitalists, this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. When you invest, you look for a return. This is universal among all investors. If you are looking for 0 return, that's not investing, that's charity. A mom and pop shop will never raise capital because selling books at the corner shop to the local community will never grow in any significant way, and so it will never generate a return. It's unreasonable to ask someone to put money into a vehicle that would not only net them no return, but over time lose them money over time due to the time value of money.\n\nCapitalism and Amazon has many faults, but it's disingenuous to claim Amazon is not being taxed because they are."|,|LateStageCapitalism|,|1555953188.0|,|mangobbt|,|eli9la4|
|b'That doesn\'t discredit the idea that Jesus was anti capitalist:\n\nJesus: "Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist of an abudnance of possessions"\n\n-(Luke 12:15).\n\n"No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money."\n\n- (Matthew 6:24)\n\nThe early church, following in Jesus\' footsteps:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they shared everything they had.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n-(Acts 4:32)\n\nJesus identifies himself with the hungry, the poor, the sick, and the prisoners.\n\nhttps://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25:31-46\n\n"You shall love your neighbour as yourself"  "And who is my neighbour?"

He is from a rural, libertarian-style conservative state that elects more Republicans in local elections. He has been elected to a series of higher offices in that environment, despite claiming Independent as his party consistently. \n\nHe did this by being pragmatic about people's reasons for wanting what they did but still agreeing on the desired outcome.

|b'>How on Earth can you talk about politics at all without talking about policy? It makes no sense.\n\nIt does happen, though.\n\nIf you ask them about policy they\'ll at best say that their favorite establishment candidate is Progressive on policy too and if you point out the ways they aren\'t they\'ll move the goal post, accuse you of having double standards if their favored candidate is a woman or POC or of being too rigid with \'purity tests\' if it\'s someone like Biden, inevitably say that \'things like what you\'re doing\' are the reason we have Trump, bring up a classic Bernie smear such as his tax returns (yes, there are people who\'ve started asking for the \'long form\' tax returns) or that essay, or just block you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\'ve tried with people like this and, especially online, a lot have made up their minds and will only hear what confirms what they already feel Bernie is like.\n\nThe most infuriating debate like this I had was shortly after the 2016 election when someone said that they\'re mad at Bernie for using sexism against Hillary and they acknowledge that Hillary used racism against Obama in 2008, but "I forgive her because she stopped before it damaged him too much to win. Bernie didn\'t."\n\nThen when I brought up the privilege in essentially crediting Hillary Clinton for Obama\'s election, she responded, "I already acknowledged that as a white woman I have privilege, so I don\'t see why you\'d say something like that other than to hurt me!"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wish I had a good answer for how to get through to these type of people, but the doughnut twitter crowd is really dug in on their BernieBro image. Case in point, the way it was somehow acceptable to a bunch of liberals to use an emoji to mock a black woman for protesting having her voice silenced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I\'m kind of banking on is that they all love to talk about how much better they are that Bernie people because they\'ll won\'t be like us and they\'ll vote Democrat even if Bernie is the candidate because they have their priorities straight when it comes to stopping Trump...so let\'s hope they mean it!'|,|SandersForPresident|,|1555953295.0|,|caraperdida|,|eli9rvz|
