"Thanks for the thoughtful response. I was the anxious kind of teenager that did consider cost when I chose my college, but I realize not everyone had the same temperament and upbringing. And their lives are probably better for it.

I think a restructuring of loans is fine to allow people to start to build wealth (eg. through a home purchase) early in life. Outright canceling doesn't seem completely fair to those who didn't take out as much debt by choosing a cheaper school or (being fortunate enough) having their parents loan it give them money. I realize those opinions are biased by my own experiences and am curious to hear your thoughts.","neoliberal","1555957659.0","Matterials","eligv7a"

"Are you talking about an in or out of state state school? It all depends of course. I went to a somewhat affordable state school in a very high COL area (DC area) and was blown away by the number of people attending from states that have plenty of good schools, paying tens of thousands extra for an education they could have gotten way cheaper.

Of course you can balance things out with financial aid, scholarships, etc. But realistically there aren't that many school and major combinations that make your undergrad school such an important choice that you want to be paying that premium when you aren't super well off.","neoliberal","1555957720.0","illwun","eligyoo"

regardless of what you study, college is nonproductive in the sense that you are foregoing wages.

"I agree with some, not all, but some of this. I do think that the massive amounts of debt available for students to assume causes schools to increase tuition. It has definitely been happening in the for-profit ""military friendly"" school sector where these ""schools"" have been providing a low-quality, easily obtainable ""education"" at the DoD maximum of $250 a credit hour. As a current student, I also see gobs of administrative jobs on campus that are completely unnecessary. For instance we have a person who gets paid to advocate for minority students and underrepresented student populations..... within the department. Multiply that by all the other departments. Schools are also wasting student's money. I get charged a healthcare fee every quarter for the campus clinic. In spite of the fact that I have 100% healthcare coverage from the Department of Veterans Affairs. And I cannot it opt out of the fee. All current students are also paying a new monthly fee to create a minority students center on campus for future minority and marginalized students to have a safe space and a place to get away from the whiteness that is so pervasive on campus. These fees are getting covered by student loans for the vast majority of students. Athletic programs should be abolished at colleges. There is no need for them, they function as a farm team subsidy for professional sports organizations.

Minus the car, this isn't necessarily a stupid financial decision. 

If you have a good rate, minimum or lower payments on your student loans make sense, especially if you are contributing aggressively to your retirement funds, which should easily have a higher annualized return than the interest rate of your student loans, and you gain the benefit of having compounding interest gains earlier. On average, building equity in a house may not yield the same returns yearly as paying off student debt, but the quality of living and happiness benefits from having a nice place to live may be worth it.

"> taking the fucking red flag and charging ahead with direct action and you people want to go ""ew, the gays, why is this in my face?"" 

That's not what's happening here. People are (rightfully) pointing out that this person's LBGTQ status has nothing to do with her termination, and thus should not be part of the conversation.

She was fired for unionizing, and that is enough reason to hate the company. I don't care if she doesn't like raisins, either, and it matters just as much as her sexual identity in this case. Her queer identity is a part of who she is, that should be celebrated, but it is completely immaterial to the situation at hand. It doesn't matter. It is extra, unneeded information. There is no reason to bring it up as it has no bearing on the situation. 

Unless you provide proof that her queer identity was part of the reason she was fired, it's just not applicable. 

>Dont expect us do the real work, the union work, of building the new world and not carve out a piece of it in our own image.

I don't think any one here expects that of you, or anyone else. Part of equality is when we have to stop pointing out our differences, and we just coexist. This feels like pointing out a difference just for the sake of pointing it out. There is nothing here to suggest that she was treated unfairly for her identity, and instead seems to have more to do capitalism than humanism. Bringing it up when there is no logical reason to do so doesn't really accomplish anything, because this would be a fucked up situation regardless of sexual preference. Unless there is proof to the contrary, we currently have no reason to believe that the employer had anything *against* her orientation or identity. What we *do* have proof of is the employer terminating her for unionizing. Stick to the important, proveable facts, and your argument ends up being stronger in the end.

The company should pay for what they've done, and that has nothing to do with being, or not being, queer.","LateStageCapitalism","1555958268.0","Rommie557","elihtas"
