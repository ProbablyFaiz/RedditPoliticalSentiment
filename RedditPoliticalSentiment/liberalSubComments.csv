"b'Your first point is just asinine. Do you think we should have never implemented social security because some people were ""responsible"" enough to save for retirement on their own? Do you think we should never lower income taxes because some people paid higher rates in the past? Policy decisions typically have disparate impacts at the individual level in an effort to improve conditions on average, or in a macro sense. If you want to stop paying off your student loans right now then feel free to do so. But I imagine you do in fact benefit from not drowning in debt, even with possible though not guaranteed public subsidization potentially on the horizon.\n\nI think your second point fails to consider a number of factors, including: 1) Warren\'s plan phases out above certain income levels, 2) This is not the only plan Warren has to address poverty and income/wealth inequality, and 3) There is potentially a great deal of economic value to be unlocked by absorbing the debts of middle and upper-middle income folks in exchange for greater participation of these highly educated people in society and the economy. For what it\'s worth, I personally do not have student loans, so the only dog I have in this fight is an interest in improving the general welfare.\n\nI agree with you that a one-time payment would be a bad policy on its own, so it\'s a good thing that Warren\'s plan doesn\'t end there. From her blog post:\n\n""Thats why Im proposing a historic new federal investment in public higher education thatwill eliminate the cost of tuition and fees at every public two-year and four-year college in America.The federal government will partner with states to split the costs of tuition and fees and ensure that states maintain their current levels of funding on need-based financial aid and academic instruction.""\n\nFree public college in addition to student loan forgiveness would reset the playing field such that taking on loans would be much more of a personal choice, rather than a necessity to receive a higher education. There is certainly a debate to be had about whether free public college is good policy, but it\'s not some totally infeasible, out-there, doomed-to-fail proposal that shouldn\'t be taken seriously.\n\nFinally, yeah, wealth taxes probably wouldn\'t work, though I do think the US has much more leverage to implement and enforce them compared to other countries that have tried them in the past. I would prefer higher taxes on the inputs to wealth -- income, capital gains, estates, etc.\n\nMy sense is that Warren (""I\'m a capitalist to my bones"") would convene knowledgeable advisors that would help shape her policies into more effective and workable versions. She\'s already indicated as much. And that quality alone sets her apart from Bernie, who may be proposing similar policies in this domain but is plainly more driven by a particular ideology than a set of guiding objectives to benefit the American people.'","neoliberal","1555954547.0","cinemagical414","elibuam"

"b'Yeah I think debt forgiveness is the wrong solution to this issue. Warren should instead find a way to make public universities cheaper, because if they are much cheaper than private universities, private universities would be in much greater competition with public schools. \n\nIMO, while student debt is a huge issue, its not the most pressing issue in our country right now, and is not worth several hundred billion dollar handout that does nothing to treat the underlying issue causing massive student debt in the US. She should start with smaller reforms, like maybe offering interest free loans to public school students and subsidizing public school expansion. A large factor in tuition cost increases is that schools are growing  buying more advanced technology, expanding their programs, buying up housing for students  and using tuition hikes to pay for it. She should subsidize this growth so students dont have to bear the cost of it. \n\nStraight up tuition caps would stop this growth, but the growth needs to happen. If the goal is to get more low income people to go to college, then colleges need to be big enough that they can have a decently high acceptance rate. If a school has a 5% acceptance rate, then odds are the students who get in are gonna be the ones who can afford private tutors, standardized test prep, and dont need to work while in high school and college.'","neoliberal","1555954676.0","_TheHalfTruth_","elic1lm"
