"b'The larger point here is that charity, while fine for some high-profile causes, is not a substitute for institutionalized, government allocations of resources. It\'s important because conservatives often operate from the assumption that charity can/should substitute for safety net programs. It cannot. \n\nBenie Sanders was just asked a question from this perspective during his Fox News town hall last week: ""A lot of millionaires and billionaires give a ton to charity you gave 3.4%"" The assumption here is that wealthy people giving to charity is how a lot of the economic inequality concerns Sanders discusses could be addressed, and also perhaps that he\'s not giving enough. \n\nCharity has long been represented as a reason the super-rich shouldn\'t have to feel bad about hoarding of absurd wealth, and is often focused on high-profile causes specifically because getting media attention for the contributor is the first goal of the contribution. Of course charities can do a lot of good, and many folks who contribute to them aren\'t seeking attention and absolution for their obscene wealth. But charities won\'t assure everyone gets paid $15/hour, or make sure everyone has health care, or tax billionaires and large corporations to fund tuition-free college for all.\n\nI\'ve gone on this long just because I\'ve been seeing this conservative \'charity as safety net\' logic more often lately, and I suspect it\'ll only increase if progressives get more traction in the presidential election.'","LateStageCapitalism","1555955493.0","jonormal","eliddp6"

"b'Hes a reactionary. https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/03/all-about-pete\n\n>Before I dive into Shortest Way Homes account of the life and career of Peter Buttigieg, let me be up front about my bias. I dont trust former McKinsey consultants. I dont trust military intelligence officers. And I dont trust the type of people likely to appear on 40 under 40 lists, the valedictorian-to-Harvard-to-Rhodes-Scholarship types who populate the American elite. I dont trust people who get flattering reams of newspaper profiles and are pitched as the Next Big Thing That You Must Pay Attention To, and I dont trust wunderkinds who become successful too early. Why? Because I am somewhat cynical about the United States meritocracy. Few people amass these kind of  rsums if they are the type to openly challenge authority. Noam Chomsky says that the factors predicting success in our meritocracy are a combination of greed, cynicism, obsequiousness and subordination, lack of curiosity and independence of mind, [and] self-serving disregard for others. So when journalists see Harvard and think impressive, I see it and think uh-oh.\n\n>I try my best to be fair, though. I thought former Michigan gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed was suspect because of his shiny rsum. But after examining his proposals and listening to his speeches, I realized he was the real deal. He had done well in school, but he was genuinely outraged by preventable human misery, talked openly about taking on corporate oligarchy, and had bold plans for revolutionizing health care, environmental policy, and just about everything else. I have lots of friends who are the products of elite institutions, but became critical of those institutions after being exposed to their inner workings. If Pete Buttigieg is one of those, great!\n\n>Pete Buttigieg is not one of those.\n\n.........................................\n\n>McKinsey is in the news almost every week for some new horrendous deed, from advising Purdue Pharma on how to turbocharge OxyContin sales to counseling dictators worldwide on how to build more efficient autocracies. A former McKinsey consultant recently wrote a long expos of the firms crimes for Current Affairs. The writer did not equivocate:  \n\n>>[If you believe that capitalisms] continued practice poses an existential threat to governments, the biosphere, and poor people the world over, then the firms role is that of a co-conspirator to a crime in which we are all victims. McKinsey is capitalism distilled. It is global, mobile, flexible, and unabashedly pro-market and pro-management. The firm has an enormous stake in things continuing more or less as they are. Working for all sides, McKinseys only allegiance is to capital. As capitals most effective messenger, McKinsey has done direct harm to the world in ways that, thanks to its lack of final decision-making power, are hard to measure and, thanks to its intense secrecy, are hard to know. The firms willingness to work with despotic governments and corrupt business empires is the logical conclusion of seeking profit at all costs. Its advocacy of the primacy of the market has made governments more like businesses and businesses more like vampires. By claiming that they solve the worlds hardest problems, McKinsey shrinks the solution space to only those that preserve the status quo.\n\n>Pete Buttigieg does not recall his time at McKinsey with a sense of moral ambivalence. Today he says it might have been his most intellectually informing experience, and by that he doesnt mean that he saw the dark underbelly of American business. No, he was learning about the nature of data. It was a thoroughly neutral experience, a place to learn. The most critical thing he will say is that he was sympathetic to those who think consulting careers less worthy than public service. But ultimately, Buttigieg only left McKinsey because it could not furnish that deep level of purpose that I craved. His sense of purpose. Have a look at the book: See if you can find a single qualm, even a moments interrogation of the nature of the company he worked for.\n\n>In fact, Buttigieg was asked in an interview what he thought of the companys misdeeds. On the work pushing OxyContin, he replied that he hadnt followed the story. On collaborating with the murderous Saudi government:\n\n>>I think you have a lot of smart, well-intentioned people who sometimes view the world in a very innocent way. I wrote my thesis on Graham Greene, who said that innocence is like a dumb leper that has lost his bell, wandering the world, meaning no harm.\n\n>The dumb leper again! Man, Buttigieg never misses a chance to cite that thesis. Vietnam was poor innocent America wandering the earth and accidentally causing a million deaths. McKinsey consultants are poor, innocent, leprous invalids, too sweet and unworldly to notice that their client is Mohammed bin Salman.'","SandersForPresident","1555955597.0","gideonvwainwright","elidjqw"
