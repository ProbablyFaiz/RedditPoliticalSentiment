"b'I do understand that concern, but I just don\'t see it as happening here in America, considering how few Muslims actually live here. There are so many other things that should be of more concern (climate change, wealth inequality, etc) that are having real effects *right now* that should be addressed over an issue which almost certainly won\'t ever come into fruition. \n\nOn your Balkans example, I think the fact that the majority of countries that emerged still being ""Christian"" shows that they weren\'t necessarily forced to change their lifestyles all that much. One of the reasons Europe has become so markedly Christian is that Christianity eradicated all of the pagan sects (minus the Jews, in some cicumstances) until there were no other alternative viewpoints. In fact, during the medieval period, the Islamic Golden Age was spurned in part due to their acceptance and tolerance of other faiths and religions, namely Jews and Christians. After the Jews were expelled from England, France, and finally Spain, where did most of them go? North Africa, Egypt, and Ottoman domains. Additionally, Islam ever only really took over the extent of North Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Central/South Asia and Europe. Considering Western powers took over almost the entire world in the name for bring civilization and Christianity to thr masses, I think it would be difficult to argue that Islam is particularly more expansionist than Christianity.\n\nThis is not at all to say Muslims have historically been more tolerant towards Jews and other religions than Christians have, but I\'m more illustrating the point that these things aren\'t necessarily tied to one religion or another. Humans will tie themselves to any ideology, be it communism, nationalism, or religion, and do terrible things because of it. These concepts aren\'t exclusive to one aspect of one religion, in my opinion.'","The_Donald","1555955942.0","Baesar","elie3q9"
