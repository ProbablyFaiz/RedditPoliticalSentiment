"This, how can so many conservatives skip over that part it amazes me. Trump was exonerated for knowingly colluding with Russia, however he was not for obstruction of Justice. Also obstruction does not require a crime or actual obstruction simply attempting to obstruct Justice is the same as actually obstructing justice because if you successfuly obstruct Justice then there will be no crime to base the charge off. Also I would like to hear the conservative take on Trump firing the director of the FBI for ""the Russia thing"" and how that is not a direct admission of obstruction.","Conservative","1555958207.0","CSGORNGesus","elihpv5"
"Description is quite vivid. Your bird sounds like some lord of the rings doom-level dream and would seriously haunt me. Wouldn't be surprised many of our normies dreaming this kind of stuff lately. Seriously, in the last few decades, we are hitting levels of dulusions where majority/govt, especially in lib places, are labeling normies as mental for believing there are only 2 genders. They think having feelings/emotions is considered having a soul. We are at a point where majority don't even know what a genuine soul is. 

Yes. Winged lion. Witnessing it terrified me. But for some reason, l felt its intention was pure. I sensed it was out to destroy those with a corrupted soul.

"Just a few of many things Christ and the apostles said about the subject. 

2 Timothy 3:12

>Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. 

John 15:18 

>If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you.

1 Peter 4:12-14 

>Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. But rejoice insofar as you share Christ's sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed. If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. 

Romans 12:14 

>Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them. 

Romans 12:17-21 

>Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all. If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all. Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, ""Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord."" To the contrary, ""if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head."" Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

And the most relevant:

John 16:2

>They will put you out of the synagogues. Indeed, the hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God
